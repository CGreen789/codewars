# Codewars
Diary to keep track of Codewars and solutions:



## 27/07/23
- Finding the next perfect square: 7 kyu
  - Used Number.isInteger and Math.sqrt()
- Convert number to reversed array of digits: 8 kyu
  - Array.from(String(n), Number) - as I needed to convert the number to strings to push them into the array.

## 24/07/23

- Square every digit: 7 kyu
  - Array.from(String(num), Number) and the + method to convert it a number at the end.
- Disemvowel Trolls: 7 kyu
  - I did this one a long time ago, but was more comfortable using regex here 

## 23/07/23

- Count of positives, sum of negatives: 8 kyu
  - Always remember to read the instructions carefully! I totally found the sum for both first...
- Sum of two lowest positive integers: 7 kyu
  - Used .sort((a, b) => a - b) to order them
